nCoda is...

- software that enables musicians across the world to create, analyze, and share music documents in a new way.
- the people building that software.

We're currently in the *alpha phase* of development, so we recommend using our software for
experimental work only. We are looking to expand the number of users testing *nCoda*,
and we are especially looking for new contributors (programmers, translators, designers, and so on).

If you're interested in contributing, get in touch on our `discussion board <https://spivak.ncodamusic.org/t/getting-started-with-ncoda>`_!

You can download the current (alpha) release of `nCoda for macOS here <https://github.com/nCoda/macOS/releases>`_.
Or download the `Linux release here <https://github.com/nCoda/Linux_Bundles/releases>`_.
