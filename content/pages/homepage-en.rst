nCoda is...

- software that enables musicians across the world to create, analyze, and share music documents in a new way.
- the people building that software.

We have recently changed direction. We are now building a collection of packages for the *Atom*
text editor. In the future, we will offer a single "nCoda" package that installs everything at once.
For now, we list our *Atom* packages here:

- `mei-tools-atom <https://atom.io/packages/mei-tools-atom>`_
- `abjadcompile <https://atom.io/packages/abjadcompile>`_
